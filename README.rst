Triangle (Single Precision Mode)
---------


*Triangle* is a python wrapper around Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's two-dimensional quality mesh generator and delaunay triangulator library, available `here <quake_>`_. This implementation utilizes Cython_ to wrap the C API as closely as possible. The source is available on Github_, and the documentation can be accessed at `rufat.be/triangle <https://rufat.be/triangle>`_.

This fork is compiled to work in single precision mode.
